Block groups have responsive `tablet-` and `phone-` prefix classes. These allow the flow of content across repeating rows of content to be easily tweaked across viewport widths in scenarios where the default [column resizing](#columns) or [responsive column classes](#responsive-columns) would be too verbose or cumbersome.


```html
<div class="block-group block-group-4-up tablet-block-group-2-up phone-block-group-1-up">
```
