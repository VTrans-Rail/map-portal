To run a development environment, just type `grunt`. You should have a copy of the documentation site live at [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888). As you develop features and fix bugs, be sure to write notes in `CHANGELOG.md`.

### How We Use GitHub

All the code for Calcite Web lives [on GitHub](https://github.com/esri/calcite-web). We use the [fork and pull model](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) to manage contribution. To contribute, you should:

1. Commit your changes.
2. Note your changes in `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Make sure your copy is up to date: `git pull upstream master`
4. Push your changes to your fork: `/your-username/calcite-web`
5. Open a pull-request from your fork (`/your-username/calcite-web`) to the 'upstream' fork (`/Esri/calcite-web`).
